# codex-first-experiments
It's just my first experiments with openAI codex (mainly javascript)

I use JavaScript infrequently, so I try this tool and maybe it would be good to exercise it with some simple JavaScript use cases. 

## introduction of codex javascript sandbox
Based on GPT-3 Codex was trained on terabytes of openly available code pulled from GitHub (73 millions programmers) and also Stack Overflow, as well as English language examples.

GPT-3 : https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.00857
 
Codex : https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2107.03374

It’s based on « Prompt engineering », the practice of using prompts to get the output you want. A prompt is a sequence of text like a sentence or a block of code.

This online application uses Codex to translate natural language instructions into JavaScript.

Playground is the other online application using Codex

**playground or Codex JavaScript Sandbox ?**

The main difference I can imagine to start with is the playground version can support multiple languages (including Python). Codex JavaScript Sandbox is restricted to javascript. In playground the access is limited after trial period but you can select a lot of parameters.

If you’re interested in configuration settings, you can take a look at the javascript sandbox’s network requests (by pressing F12 to see your browser’s Developer tools) and see what it is sending over in terms of temperature/response length.

The entire payload is:
